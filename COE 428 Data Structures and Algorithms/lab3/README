1. The merge sort and insertion has been implemented 
successfully. Due to a pascal denying access I was
unable to test my sorts. However, they compile successfully.
Both sorting algorithms were implemented using the textbook. A
major issue I faced early was the use of mySwap
and myCompare, however after closely analysing I was able
to implement it.

2. 
Insertion sort :
The best case O(n) time with 0 swaps, n moves and n-1 number of comparisons.
The average case O(n^2) time with n-1 moves, and n(n-1)/2 swaps and compares.
The worse case has the same equations as the average case.

Merge Sort :
The best case has O(nlogn) time with 0 swaps and n-1 compares.
All of the average cases for merge sort excluding time depends on the array.Time
however is the same for all cases being O(nlogn). The worst case also depends on the array.
